# FizzBuzz_JS

The classic basic programming test, based in conditional logic and iteration.<br>
In this case we are talking about JS, I tried to make the experience more interesting<br>
by adding some animations to the html elements and some event on click!<br>
<br>
<br>
# MODDED VERSION <br> 
Added the possibility to decide the interval, the # of multiplies and the associated word
via a starting form, with compiling controls.
<br>
<br>
# USED TECHNOLOGY<br>
 - HTML<br>
    - FLEXBOX<br>
 - CSS<br>
    - BEM METHODOLOGY & REUSING POLICY<br>
 - BASIC JAVASCRIPT RULES<br>
 - <b>ADDING JEST FOR TESTING FUNCTIONS (work in progress)</b>
 
 ENJOY!
